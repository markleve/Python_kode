Machine learning MNIST data
======

Some code I made while having the course INF5860 at UiO. The course focuses on machine
learning for image analysis.

#### Code objective
The MNIST dataset is used to build the machine learning algorithms. In one of the programs
the algorithm is created using tensorflow, which is GoogleÂ´s deep learning library. In the
other program, the algorithm is created from scratch using Python code.



## Using the program
The tensorflow program needs a tensorflow environment to be executed. If a tensorflow
environment is made in ex. Anaconda, the following code can be executed to activate the
tensorflow environment
```
source activate tensorflow
```

## Inputfil
The MNIST data is the input for both programs.
