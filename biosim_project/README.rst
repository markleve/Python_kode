Biosim
======
Pair programming in INF200 at NMBU, january 2016.

This biosim-project is a model of the ecosystem of Rossumisland. The ecosystem is characterized by five different landscape types:
   - Jungle
   - Savannah
   - Desert
   - Mountain
   - Ocean

The whole island is surrounded by ocean, and only two species of animals live there, herbivores and carnivores.

The "BioSim_project_description.pdf" file described the project task and guidelines for the project. To run the program, run the "check_sim.py" file. A simulation of herbivores and carnivores living together on the island will then appear. An example of the simulation if found in the "simulation_example.mp4" file.
