Pair programming in INF200 at NMBU, january 2016.

This biosim-project is a model of the ecosystem of Rossumisland. The ecosystem is characterized by five different landscape types:
   - Jungle
   - Savannah
   - Desert
   - Mountain
   - Ocean

The whole island is surrounded by ocean, and only two species of animals live there, herbivores and carnivores.
