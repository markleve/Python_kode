Description: Biosim
        ======
        
        This biosim-project is a model of the ecosystem of Rossumisland.
        The ecosystem is characterized by five different landscape types:
           - Jungle
           - Savannah
           - Desert
           - Mountain
           - Ocean
        
        The whole island is surrounded by ocean, and only two species of animals live
        there, herbivores and carnivores.
        
        This simulation of the ecosystem of Rossumisland is given as a group project in
        INF200 at NMBU, january 2016.
